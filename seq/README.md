Here's a brief explanation of the components of this seq `docker-compose.yml` file:

- `version`: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format. Version '3.7' is used here for compatibility with a wide range of Docker Compose versions.
- `services`: Defines the services to be run as part of your setup. In this case, there's only one service: seq.
    - `image`: Specifies the Docker image to use for the service. datalust/seq:latest pulls the latest Seq image from Datalust's Docker Hub repository.
    - `environment:`
        - `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` is required to indicate your acceptance of the Seq End User License Agreement. Seq will not start without this.
    - `volumes:`

        - `seq-data:/data` mounts a named volume (seq-data) to the container's /data directory, where Seq stores its data. This ensures that your Seq data persists across container restarts and updates.
    - `ports:`

        - `"5341:80"` maps port 80 inside the container (the default port for Seq's web interface) to port 5341 on the host. This allows you to access the Seq UI by navigating to http://localhost:5341 in your web browser.
- `volumes`: Defines the volumes used by your services. seq-data is a named volume that Docker manages, ensuring data persistence for Seq


## Running

run `docker-compose up -d`. This command pulls the Seq image (if it's not already local), creates the seq-data volume (if it doesn't exist), and starts the Seq container in detached mode.

After the container starts, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5341 to access the Seq UI.
